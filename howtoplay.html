    <h1>How to play Splendor!</h1>
    <p>
      This is my version of Splendor, which is not far off from the original
      version of the popular card game. I will point out where the rules of the
      original and this game differ. The main goal of this game is to get to 15
      points or higher. Sounds simple! The way in which you get to 15 involves
      you purchasing cards throughout the game that allow you to accumulate 15
      points.
